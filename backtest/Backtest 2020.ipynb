If you're unsure what a normal distribution looks like and why we chose these percentages, I suggest researching these so that you have a better understanding of the statistics behind this).  The companies in the top 25% for a metric may be outliers or overvalued based on that number, and the companies in the lower 25% may be underperforming.  \n",

Remember, runtime is **_exponential_**.*  One of our current tasks for improving the model is to develop an algorithm to calculate the step value; for example if the range starts at 20 and goes up to 120, a step of 10 has 12 potential frame values, while a step value of 5 has 24.  The fewer frame values we have, the more quickly the code will run; too large of a step value, and we may be distorting the accuracy of the backtest.\n",

    "### Cartesian Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll look at the Cartesian product.  This is where things get slightly more mathematical, and where we can fully grasp the importance of efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The only argument of the prod() function is the sector name, and this is just to pass to other functions which need that name to create our .csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This for loop is the heart of our backtest.  Keep in mind that in python, a function can be called in the for loop if it returns a list which can be traversed.  In this case, that function is the product() function; more specifically, this creates a Cartesian product.  From thefreedictionary.com:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A cartesian product is \"the set of all ordered pairs of members of two given sets. The product A × B is the set of all pairs <a, b> where a is a member of A and b is a member of B.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Think of it like this.  Say we have two sets of numbers, A and B.  Say that A has the values (1, 2, 3) and B has the values (4, 5, 6).  A cartesian product between A and B would produce  all of these possible sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1, 4)\n",
    "(1, 5)\n",
    "(1, 6)\n",
    "(2, 4)\n",
    "(2, 5)\n",
    "(2, 6)\n",
    "(3, 4)\n",
    "(3, 5)\n",
    "(3, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each number from A is combined with each number from B.  Note that the number of possible sets is equal to the number of values in A times the number of values in B: 3 x 3 = 9.  If B had four numbers, there would be 3 x 4 = 12 possible combinations, and so forth and so on.  Now consider how this works with our ranges; an example for the number of values in each range is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    peRange = 4 possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "    pbRange = 5 possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "    epsRange = 6 possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "    deRange = 4 **\n",
    "\n",
    "    fcfRange = 4 **\n",
    "\n",
    "    roeRange = 4 **\n",
    "\n",
    "    roaRange = 3 **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4 x 5 x 6 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 3 = 23,040 possible combinations.  This is the number of frames that the for loop would have to run through.  Say that roaRange changed from 3 to 4; this would give us 30,720 combinations.  As you can see, the ranges create an exponentially large set of combinations; this is why the backtest takes so long to run, and why efficiency is so important.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the rest of the function work?  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The for loop takes a single frame from the cartesian product and calls the calculatePortLoop function from above.  As we know, this adds data to the SectorNameIndPortPeriodDate.csv file and to the portSummaryDF dataframe.\n",
    "2. dfTotalPort is the dataframe to show the final results.  We calculate the average return for the frame over time as well as the average beta, and insert these into the dfTotalPort dataframe.\n",
    "3. The frame values are copied into dfTotalPort.\n",
    "4. The SectorNameIndividualPortfoliosDate.csv is printed to using the portSummaryDF dataframe.\n",
    "5. The loop continues to do this for each frame.\n",
    "6. After the loop has finished, the total Treynor for each frame is calculated using the average beta and average return for each frame over time, as well as risk-free rate.  This data is added to the dfTotalPort dataframe.\n",
    "7. The dfTotalPort dataframe is then sorted by Treynor ratio, with the highest Treynors appearing at the top. Keep in mind that Treynor ratio shows return vs. risk.  Higher Treynor values are considered better, so the first Treynor listed on this sheet will be for the best frame.\n",
    "8. Similar to above, identifying tags are again generated for each frame.  They match the format as in the last function.\n",
    "9.  outputTotalPort is called, allowing for us to print out the SectorNameTotalPortfolioDate.csv file."
